    <p>This page will give some detail about my favorite dogs, they are called Great Pyrenees.
They come from the Pyrenean Mountains, and they are livestock protectors.
Specifically they protect sheep, they are white because that allows them to fit in with the animals that they guard.
	<body>They are huge and lovable. They are also protectors.
